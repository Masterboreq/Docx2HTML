# Docx2HTML

This is a fork of the original repository [Docx-to-HTML](https://github.com/xylude/Docx-to-HTML/) created by [Jason Crider (xylude)](https://github.com/xylude).
My initial purpose to for this repository was my need of converting a whole bunch of various DOCX files for a machine, automated processing.

Description
============
Converts .docx files to HTML

This is a PHP class that converts files in DOCX format to pure HTML. The project is on the early stage of a development.

The class requires the following extensions to be up and running in your PHP runtime:

- [ZipArchive](http://php.net/manual/en/class.ziparchive.php)
- [SimpleXML](http://php.net/manual/en/book.simplexml.php)


## How to use
Simply run the existing ```poc.php``` script in your browser which is present in the ```master``` branch.
